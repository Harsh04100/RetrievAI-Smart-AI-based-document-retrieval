Document RetrievAI is an AI-based document retrieval system that utilizes the power of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) to find relevant infomation from documents for user queries. This project aims to simplify and enhance the process of retrieving documents from a large collection based on natural language queries.

## Features

- Utilizes GPT to process user queries and retrieve relevant documents.
- Handles large document collections efficiently using indexing techniques.
- Supports various document formats such as text, PDF, and HTML.
- Easy-to-use API for integrating the retrieval system into other applications.
